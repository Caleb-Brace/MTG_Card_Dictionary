# MTG_Card_Dictionary

A visual basic application used to store/manage a card collection. Utilizing a class structure to apply common card properties, 
objects are created to simulate each unique card entry. Form traversing events are applied after data entry. A dictionary object is used to manage
the text based entry of the card and is used to read/write to an external text file.
